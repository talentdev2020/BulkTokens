# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

## install packages
   npm install
## deploy
   npm run deploy
## test
   npm run test

## verify
  npx hardhat verify CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  
  - if the contract has parameters, 
   
    npx hardhat verify --constructor-args arguments.js CONTRACT_ADDRESS

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
